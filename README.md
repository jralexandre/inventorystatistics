# Inventory Statistics

A mod inspired on creating ways to show how fast you are using or creating your resources.

## Requirements:
- Minecraft 1.16.5
- Applied Energistics 2

## Added items

In the first version there is a ME Item Speed Monitor, which integrates with AE2 to show how fast the configured item is changing. 

The plan for the mod is to create more ways to measure item rates.

### ME Item Speed Monitor

Works just like the AE2 ME Storage Monitor, but shows the item rate for the configured item. Right click with an item to set what to show. Right click with the same item to change units (per tick, seconds or minutes).
